# companyWebsite
I have created a website with a number of features using Linux, Apache2, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP Stack). These include create a username and login system using MySQL, creating a secure image upload system using PHP, creating a public and private profile system which allows a user to upload a text description, images, and
an embedded youtube video. Also, I have created a search system using Apacha SOLR to search through all public profiles on the website. I have made the choice to 
only put screenshots of the different features of my webdsite online and not the code because I plan on using this code in a commerical product. However, if you are involved in reviewing an application for an internship I am applying to, please feel free me to use the contact information in my resume to contact me about this project to discuss it in greater detail.


FAQ

1.
    Q. Why does the browser say "not secure" for its HTTPS certificate?
    A. Given the fact that I have chosen to host this project website on my local computer instead of
       a cloud hosting provider as I have done in the past, I created a self-signed HTTPS for use in 
       this project. Since this website is only being hosted on my own personal computer at this
       point, it is not a problem. However, Chrome has a general rule saying that websites with self
       signed certificates are not secure. This would definitely not be the case for the finished
       project of this website, as I would use a service like Let's Encrypt to create a trusted
       HTTPS certificate. If you are involved in reviewing an application for an internship I am
       applying to, please feel free me to use the contact information in my resume to contact me 
       about this project to discuss it in greater detail.
      
      
 Future Plans:
     I plan on adding a feature that will allow services to be scheduled by users for
     different vendors with public pages. If you are involved in reviewing an application for an 
     internship I am applying to, please feel free me to use the contact information in my resume to 
     contact me about this project to discuss it in greater detail, including any updates I plan to
     make to the project.
